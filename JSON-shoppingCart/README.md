## A small application built with CSS HTML and Asyncronous Javascript.

## Pulls data from a local JSON file and maps it out to be displayed to the user.

### Possible improvements:

- A filter field to allowe user search for book under an specific keyword.
- Form handling error massages i.e "no book have been found", "search field cannot be empty", "enter more than 3 charecters"
